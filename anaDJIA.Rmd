## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to analyse the historical daily
returns from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).

## Data Source

Historical data was obtained from
[measuringworth.com](http://measuringworth.com/DJA/) and 
downloaded as a `.csv` file. The original file was stored in 
this repository without modification.
They describe their data cleaning process
[here](http://measuringworth.com/DJA/DowSource.htm).

**Note:** This is a work in progress and is *not* ready for prime time.
